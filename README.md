<h1> Garbage_Classifier </h1>

We have built a CNN model to predict the type of garbage by training it from a set of 6 different classes. <br>
  - Cardboard
  - Glass
  - Metal
  - Paper
  - Plastic
  - Trash  
<br>
 We've used the architecture of Xception Model along with a learning rate scheduler and custom callbacks to try and prevent over-fitting.
<br>

 Please refer to my kaggle notebook for detailed comments on the code
